# When to use this asset?
 
Every organization generates large amounts of assets daily, often duplicating efforts. Managing assets effectively means being able to efficiently store, collaborate on, find, and publish your assets, whether they are text, images, videos, or content items structured with all of those things. Letâ€™s look at some of the Oracle Content Management features available to manage and publish your assets.

Oracle Content Management's content management structure starts with repositories. A repository is a storage location for assets that you need for building web, mobile, or other user experiences in your organization. An asset can be a content item that represents an individual piece of content, such as a blog post, case study, or product information; or a digital asset that represents an image, video, or other type of media that you need in your experiences.
