## **1. Introduction**

Welcome to the Landing Zone Framework (LZF) Solution Definition Asset.

The content of this asset will guide you through the **landing zone design decisions**, and help select the best **approach** and **solution** to setup and run your OCI Landing Zone.

Using an OCI Landing Zone will enable a **secured OCI Tenancy**, with operational control and governance, ready to **onboard** and **run**  workloads with **network isolation** and with the right **segregation of duties** in the organization.

&nbsp; 

## **2. Design Considerations**

Before choosing the approach and solution, it's important to understand the design considerations and related decisions to be made to successfully run OCI. 

In the next sections the design considerations are presented for security, network, and operations topics. It's recommended to iterate over these elements as they will guide the design process, simplify the understanding of OCI core resources, and clarify the day-two operations. 

Find [**here**](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz/blob/master/design/OCI_Open_LZ.pdf) an example of a complete **landing zone design** document following this proposed structure. Note that this document is a complete reference blueprint, simplified versions can be created with low efforts.


&nbsp; 

## 2.1 Security 

The following table presents the recommended security topics to review in the landing zone design.

&nbsp; 

| ID  |  TOPIC | DESCRIPTION | OCI RESOURCES
|---|---|---|---|
| **SD.01** | **Tenancy Structure** |  Compartment structure to support resource grouping, separation of duties, budget control and billing, and workloads. | Compartments | 
| **SD.02**| **Identity and Access Management** | The groups, dynamic groups, and policies for the related duties and compartments. | Groups & Policies | 
| **SD.03**| **Security Posture** |  Additional configurations for OCI native security tooling. | Cloud Guard, Security Zones, Vulnerability Scanning, etc. | 

&nbsp; 

## 2.2 Network 

The following table presents the recommended network topics to review in the landing zone design. The first two topics are highly recommended while the last two can be optional depending on requirements.

&nbsp; 


| ID  |  TOPIC | DESCRIPTION | OCI RESOURCES
|---|---|---|---|
| **ND.01** | **Network Structure** | Network elements to support the workloads and network segregation. | VCNs, Subnets, DRG, Gateways | 
| **ND.02**| **Network Security** |  Network areas and their security posture. | NSGs, Security Lists, Gateways, Firewalls | 
| **ND.03**| **Network Connectivity** | Connection to on-premises or other cloud providers with network traffic scenarios. | FastConnec, Site-to-site VPN. </br> ND.01, ND.02 Resources. | 
| **ND.04**| **DNS** | Naming resolution and how DNS zones and records are solved to handle domain DNS queries. |  VCNs, Subnets, Resolvers, and Endpoints. | 

&nbsp; 

## 2.3 Operations 

The following table presents the recommended operational topics to review in the landing zone design.

| ID  |  TOPIC | DESCRIPTION | OCI RESOURCES
|---|---|---|---|
| **OD.01** | **Teams** | Cloud operations teams responsible for running (provisioning and changing) OCI landing zone and OCI workloads. | Relates to SD01 and SD.02 | 
| **OD.02** | **Tooling** |  Tools to run OCI, used for provisioning and changing of resources. | OCI Console, ORM, CLI, Terraform, SDK, Pipelines, Git, etc. | 
| **OD.03**| **Operating Model** |  The modus operandi to provision and change resources with the tooling by the cloud operations teams. | Relates to OD.01, OD.02 | 
| **OD.04**| **Operatinal Integrations** |  Integrate OCI Landing Zone with external systems, such as SIEM or Monitoring. | Relates to SD.01, SD.02, SD.03, ND.01, ND.03 | 

&nbsp; 


## **3. Landing Zone Zone Approach**


There are two types of landing zone approaches to consider:

&nbsp; 

| APPROACH  |  DESCRIPTION | 
|---|---|
| [**Standard Landing Zones**](/landing-zones/standard_landing_zones/standard_landing_zones.md) | **Prescribed** and **ready to use** solutions with a **guided setup** and  **IaC**. This is the recommended approach for initial landing zone deployments covering the most common workload scenarios.  | 
| [**Tailored Landing Zones**](/tailored_landing_zones/tailored_landing_zones.md) | An approach to solve **specific requirements** when the standard is not enough. These LZs run with **configuration-as-code** and are used to scale/bridge with existing **operating models**, complying with fine-grained **segregations of duties**, strong **network isolation**, and heterogeneous **workloads**.  |  

&nbsp; 

The guidance we recommend to follow is very simple:

- If you're **starting** with OCI landing zones use a **standard landing zone** as they're full of best practices. If it needs adjustments or extensions on top of the prescribed design, customize it by code or manually. This approach is described in [section 4](#4-standard-landing-zones).
- If your **requirements are very specific/detailed**, or they imply structural changes to a standard landing zone, and/or you need a highly scalable operating model, **use the tailored approach** described in   [section 5](#5-tailored-landing-zones).

&nbsp; 


## **4. Standard Landing Zones**

The **CIS Landing Zone** is the recommended solution to start with standard landing zones. It proposes a design that covers:
- Security Design Decisions (SD.01, SD.02, and SD.03) covered in [section 2.1](#21-security).
- Network Design Decisions (ND.01, ND.02, and ND.03) covered in [section 2.2](#22-network).
- Operations Design Decision (OD.02) covered in [section 2.3](#23-operations).


For complete guidance on the **configuration** and **deployment** of this solution refer to this [**LZF asset dedicated to the CIS Landing Zone**](/landing-zones/standard_landing_zones/cis_lz_v2/cis_landing_zone_v2.md).

For guidande on **extending** this solution with OCI resources on top of the standard model review the [section 4](/landing-zones/standard_landing_zones/cis_lz_v2/cis_landing_zone_v2.md#4-extend-the-solution) of the same asset.



&nbsp; 

## **5. Tailored Landing Zones**



For guiding you on the tailoring of your landing zone we recommend the use the [**LZF asset dedicated to this approach**](/tailored_landing_zones/tailored_landing_zones.md). This asset  describes all the **recommended steps** for **designing** and **running** your landing zone:
- In terms of **design**, to tailor a landing zone we recommend using the [**OCI Open LZ Blueprint**](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz). If follows all [design considerations](/landing-zones/commons/lz_solution_definition.md#2-design-considerations) above except OD.04.
- In terms of **deployment** and **running** your landing zone design, we recommend the use of the **[CIS Landing Zone Enhanced Modules](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/post/cis-landing-zone-enhanced-modules)**, to **configure** the resources with *json/hcl* terraform native interfaces.
