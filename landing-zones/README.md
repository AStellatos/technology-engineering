# **Landing Zone Framework**

&nbsp; 


Welcome to the **Landing Zone Framework (LZF)**. 

The LZF is a set of assets that aim to **simplify the OCI onboarding experience** and **reduce OCI day-one and day-two efforts**. It provides **best practices** covering the complete spectrum of OCI landing zones, from the **standards** to  **tailored** approaches.

&nbsp; 


| APPROACH  |  DESCRIPTION | 
|---|---|
| <a href="/landing-zones/standard_landing_zones/standard_landing_zones.md" ><img src="images/slz.png" alt= “” width="600" height=""></a>  | **Prescribed** and **ready to use** solutions with a **guided setup** and  **IaC**. This is the recommended approach for initial landing zone deployments covering the most-common workload scenarios.  | 
| <a href="tailored_landing_zones/tailored_landing_zones.md" ><img src="images/tlz.png" alt= “” width="600" height=""> </a>  | An approach to solve **specific requirements** when the standard is not enough. The  designs are transformed into a **configuration-as-code** solution, simple to set up, and used to scale/bridge with existing operating models,  fine-grained segregations of duties, strong network isolation, or heterogeneous workload   |  
&nbsp; 

If you're **starting with OCI landing zones**:
1. Start with a **standard** landing zone as they're full of best practices. If it needs adjustments or **extensions on top** of the prescribed design, customize it by code or manually. 
2. If your design is very **specific**, requiring **structural changes** to a standard landing zone, and/or you need a **highly scalable operating model**, use the **tailored** approach.

&nbsp; 

The following **assets** are also available to improve the OCI landing experience:
- [Resource Naming Conventions](/landing-zones/commons/resource_naming_conventions.md)
- [User Identity Management](/landing-zones/commons/user_identity_management.md)
- [Budgets and Tagging](/landing-zones/commons/budgets_and_tagging.md)
