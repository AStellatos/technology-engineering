#  Virtual Test Access Points (VTAP) 

A Virtual Test Access Point (VTAP) provides a way to mirror traffic from a designated source to a selected target to facilitate troubleshooting, security analysis, and data monitoring. The VTAP uses a capture filter, which contains a set of rules governing what traffic a VTAP mirrors. A VTAP is STOPPED by default at creation, so you need to click the Start VTAP before it mirrors traffic as intended.

You can create a capture filter while you create a VTAP, or assign an existing capture filter to a new VTAP

VTAP sources can be:

    A single compute instance VNIC in a subnet
    A Load Balancer
    A Database system
    An Exadata VM Cluster
    An Autonomous Database for Analytics and Data Warehousing instance using a private endpoint
