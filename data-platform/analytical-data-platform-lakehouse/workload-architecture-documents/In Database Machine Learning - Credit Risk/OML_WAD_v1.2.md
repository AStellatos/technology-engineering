<!-- EXAMPLE / TEMPLATE -->
This document provides a high-level solution definition for the Oracle solution and aims at describing the current state, to-be state as well as a potential 'Oracle Lift' project scope and timeline. The Lift parts will be described as a physical implementable solution. The intended purpose is to provide all parties involved a clear and well-defined insight into the scope of work and intention of the project as it will be done as part of the Oracle Lift service.

The document may refer to a 'Workload', which summarizes the full technical solution for a customer (You) during a single engagement. The Workload is described in chapter [Workload Requirements and Architecture](#workload-requirements-and-architecture). In some cases Oracle offers a free implementation service called 'Oracle Lift', which has its own dedicated scope and is typically a subset of the initial Workload. The Lift project, architecture and implementation details are documented in chapter [Oracle Lift Project and Architecture](#oracle-lift-project-and-architecture) and in chapter [Oracle Lift Implementation](#oracle-lift-implementation).

The client is developing a new line of business where they will provide credit financing to importers and exporters. The approval process for the credit solution will be quicker than with banks. At the time of booking a consignment, the booking agent can offer it in real-time, saving a great deal of time on paperwork and approval procedures.

A precise credit risk scoring algorithm is crucial for this new service. Machine learning and data science can use historical trade information and make classifications and predictions about importer or exporter credit worthiness. Machine learning models will use 3rd party data and Fusion ERP data since this data is based on factual audited trade information that provides high confidence in data quality.

# Workload Requirements and Architecture

## Overview
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Describe the Workload: What applications and environments are part of this Workload, what are their names? Lift will be scoped later and is typically a subset of the Workload. For example a Workload could exists of two applications, but Lift would only include one environment of one application. This Workload chapter is about the whole Workload and Lift will be described late in chapter [Scope](#scope).

## Functional Requirements
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Provide a brief overview of the functional requirements, the functional area they belong to, the impacted business processes, etc.

Provide a formal description of the requirements as 1. a set of Use Cases or 2. a description of Functional Capabilities or 3. a Requirement Matrix. The three descriptions are not mutually exclusive.

Some Workload team, especially the Analytics and Merging Tech teams, will create new application based on functional requirements, some Workload team will not touch the functional requirements at all and just change the platform under an application. But it is important to understand who is using the system and for what reason.

### Requirement Matrix
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
A Requirement Matrix can be used when the solution will be based on software capabilities already available in existing components (either custom or vendor provided). The Requirements Matrix is a matrix that is used to capture client requirements for software selection and to evaluate the initial functional “fit” of a vendor’s software solution to the business needs
of the client.

For example, rows can list required functional capabilities and columns can list available software components. Cells can contain a simple Y/N or provide more detail. The Requirements Matrix also is used to identify initial functional gaps or special software enhancements needed to enable each vendor’s software to fulfill the client’s desired system capabilities.

### Resilience and Recovery
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
This section captures the resilience and recovery requirements for the Workload. Note that these may be different from the current system.

The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirement of each environment should be captured in the environments section above, and wherever possible, these should be mapped to the standard Bronze, Silver and Gold levels of Oracle's MAA.

- What are RTO and RPO requirements of the Application?
- What are SLA's of the application?
- What are the backup requirements

Note that if needed, this section may also include an overview of the proposed backup and disaster recovery proposed architectures.

This chapter is mandatory, while there could be no requirements on HA/DR, please mention that in a short single sentence.

Mandatory Chapter
-->

At the time of this document creation, no Resilience or Recovery requirements have been specified.

Workload resilience is achieved by the intrinsic capabilities of ExaCS and OAC and providing Service Level Objectives as described in ["Oracle PaaS and IaaS Public Cloud Services Pillar Document"](https://www.oracle.com/assets/paas-iaas-pub-cld-srvs-pillar-4021422.pdf).

**Recovery** can be achieved by leveraging:

- __OAC__ :
  - __OAC system-generated backups :__ Oracle regularly do system-generated backups (daily, and also when a change is done on the data model and keep them for 30 days) of the entire Oracle Analytics Cloud environment, including system configuration and user content. Oracle Support Services use these system-generated backups to restore an environment that becomes corrupt, but these system-generated backups aren't accessible to customers and they’re not intended to provide customer-requested recovery points. Customer must use the snapshot feature (described below) to back up and restore user content.

  - __OAC Snapshots__ : Customer should regularly back up the content that users create to a file called a snapshot. User content includes catalog content such as reports, dashboards, data visualization workbooks, and pixel perfect reports, datasets, data flows, data models, security roles, service settings, and so on. If something goes wrong with your content or service, you can revert to the content you saved in a snapshot. Snapshots are also useful if there is a requirement to move or share content from one service to another. Oracle Analytics Cloud Snapshot is described [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/analytics-cloud/acabi/snapshots.html#GUID-FAE709DE-3370-457C-9015-2E088ACA6181)

    Oracle recommends to take snapshots at significant checkpoints, for example, before making a major change to the content or environment. In addition, Oracle recommends taking regular weekly snapshots or at defined frequency based on the rate of change of the environment and rollback requirements. These Snapshots are can be downloaded to in order to store them locally.

  - To implement a disaster recovery, a well-architected business continuity plan should be designed in order to recover as quickly as possible and continue to provide services to Oracle Analytics Cloud users. Oracle recommends to do snapshots regularly and restore the content to a redundant Oracle Analytics Cloud environment (that can be only powered on during restore process) in another region if possible to mitigate the risk of region-wide events.

- __ADW__ :

   - __ADW automated backups__ : that have a retention period of 60 days and that allow to restore and recover the ADW database to any point-in-time in this retention period. Manual backups can also be performed and stored in an Object Storage bucket, if needed, for instance to have a higher retention period.


### Management and Monitoring
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
This subsection captures any requirements for integrations into the customer's existing management and monitoring systems - e.g. system monitoring, systems management etc. Also, if the customer requires new management or monitor capabilities, these should also be recorded.

Optional Chapter

### Security
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Capture the non functional requirements for security related topics. Security is a mandatory subsection which is to be reviewed by the x-workload security team. The requirements can be separated into:
- Identity and Access Management
- Data Security

Other security topics, such as network security, application security or other can be added if needed.

Mandatory Chapter
-->

At the time of this document creation, no Security requirements have been specified.

#### Identity and Access Management
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
The requirements for identity and access control. This section describes any requirements for
authentication, identity management, single-sign-on and necessary integrations to retained customer systems
(e.g. corporate directories)
- Is there any Single Sign On or Active Directory Integration Requirement?
- Is the OS hardened if so please share the hardening guide line?

Recommended Chapter
-->

The proposed solution consists of ADW, Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) and OCI Golden Gate which are fully managed by Oracle (OCI PaaS), and therefore have very small attack surface. Authentication and authorization of users done by enterprise-grade identity and access management services of OCI.

#### Data Security
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Capture any specific or special requirements for data security. This section should also describe any additional constraints such as a requirement for data to be held in a specific locations or for data export restrictions

Recommended Chapter
-->

## Constraints and Risks
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Constraints are limitations which will impact the resulting project or Solution Architecture. It is a technology- or project-related condition or event that prevents the project from fully delivering the ideal solution to customers and end-users. Constraints can be identified on our customer, partner or even Oracle's side.

A project risk is an uncertain event that may or may not occur during a project.

Describe constraints and risks affecting the Workload and possible Logical Solution Architecture. These can be of technical nature, but might also be non-technical. Consider: budgets, timing, preferred technologies, skills in the customer organization, location, etc.

**Main Components:**

### Data Ingestion & Data Refinery
- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Integration** will be used to process and transform data that is coming from Fusion ERP and ingest it into Autonomous Database.

- **OCI Golden Gate** will be used to replicate the data from the database of 3rd Party Application to Autonomous Database.

### Serving/Data Persistance

- **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse** will serve as the source of the curated data that will be used to create the AutoML data preparation and feature engineering. By leveraging Autonomous Oracle Database and the power of Exadata in the cloud, data preparation over historical data will perform better.

- **Object Storage** - is an internet-scale, high-performance storage platform that offers reliable and cost-efficient data durability. Object Storage can also be used as a cold storage layer for the Autonomous Databases by storing data that is used infrequently and then joining it seamlessly with the most recent data by using hybrid tables in the Oracle Database.

### Data Access & Interpret

**Learn and Predict**

- **Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks** give data scientists, business analysts, and analysts of data a collaborative user interface to work with SQL and Python interpreters in Oracle Autonomous Database.

  Oracle Machine Learning Services supports third-party classification or regression models that can be built using packages like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, among others and then exported in ONNX format. Oracle Machine Learning Services supports integrated cognitive text analytics for topic discovery, keywords, summary, sentiment, and similarity. Oracle Machine Learning Services also supports image classification via third-party ONNX format model deployment, and supports scoring using images or tensors.

  Users can also predict directly in the database using in-database models from SQL and Python for singleton, small batch, and large-scale batch scoring. Users can leverage OML4PY embedded Python execution to invoke user-defined Python function with models produced from third-party packages and make predictions from Python and REST interfaces.

  The customer will use automated machine learning (**AutoML**) to benefit from automated algorithm and feature selection, and for automated model tuning and selection.

  Oracle Machine Learning AutoML User Interface (OML AutoML UI) is a no-code user interface that provides automated machine learning with ease of deployment to Oracle Machine Learning Services. Business users without extensive data science background can use OML AutoML UI to create and deploy machine learning models as well as generate an OML notebook containing the corresponding OML4PY code to rebuild the model and score data programmatically.


  **OML services** will be used by applications to call the models through REST APIs. OML Services enables application development by providing REST endpoints to deployed machine learning models. Any REST API client tool or programming language can be used to invoke the REST endpoints available through OML Services.

**Visualize and Learn**

**Oracle Analytics Cloud** Business users will have access to the customer's final data/variables and the evaluation of their credit score results in Oracle Analytics Dashboards.  It is scalable and secure public self-service & enterprise Visualization service that provides a full set of capabilities to explore and perform collaborative analytics.

**Governance**

- **OCI Data Catalog** - is a crucial component in governing the data and information landscape providing visibility to where technical assets such as metadata and respective attributes reside as well as offering the ability to maintain a business glossary that is mapped to that technical metadata. Data Catalog can also serve metadata to be consumed by ADB in order to facilitate external tables creation in those autonomous databases.

- **Data Safe** - is a unified control center for Oracle Databases which helps you understand the sensitivity of your data, evaluate risks to data, mask sensitive data, implement and monitor security controls, assess user security, monitor user activity, and address data security compliance requirements. Data Safe will be used to 1) audit and implement security controls namely on the production database as well as 2) sensitive data discovery and masking of non prod environments that might originate from production copies/replicas.


**CI/CD**

- **OCI DevOps Service** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DevOps service is a complete continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform for developers to simplify and automate their software development lifecycle. The OCI DevOps service enables developers and operators to collaboratively develop, build, test, and deploy software. Developers and operators get visibility across the full development lifecycle with a history of source commit through build, test, and deploy phases.

**Security & IAM**

- **IDCS** - Identity Cloud Service is the service that allows to manage identities and permissions for the various OCI services users and can be integrated/federated with external Identity Providers, on this case, One Identity.
- **IAM** - OCI Identity and Access Management allows controlling who has access to cloud resources. It can control what type of access a group of users have and to which specific cloud resources. It is a key component of segregating resources and restricting access only to authorised groups and users. OCI IAM, and in fact, OCI as a whole implements a [Zero Trust Security](https://www.oracle.com/security/what-is-zero-trust/#link1) model of which one of the guiding principles is least privilege access; in fact, a user by default doesn't have access to any resources and policies need to be created explicitly to grant groups of users access to cloud resources.


### Physical Architecture
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--

The Workload Architecture is typically not described in a physical form. If we deliver a Lift project, the scoped Lift Project in chapter 4 includes the physical architecture.

Nevertheless, an architect might want to describe the full physical Workload here, if this is a non-Lift project or if 3rd party implementation partner implement the non Lift environments.

This section's physical future state architecture serves as the first iteration of the Credit Risk system that might be provisioned in OCI. As a result, the physical future state architecture will be refined in accordance with the customer's low level requirements, and those refinements and the final solution will be detailed in WAD in the future.

![Physical Architecture](assets/MLAI_WAD_v.0.3-1bbe09ab.png)

- **Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)** will be provisioned in a private subnet.
- **Oracle Cloud Analytics Private Access Channel (OAC PAC)** will be used to connect the OAC to the ADW residing
in the private subnet.
- **ADW** will be provisioned in the private subnet.
- **OCI Data integration** will be prepared in the private subnet.
- **Data Catalog** will be ready to use when the tenancy is created.
- **Object storage** will be ready to use when the tenancy is created.
- **Monitoring/Logging**  tools ready to use to monitor OCI Services and related Logs.
- **OCI IAM Identity Domains** is automatically provided and ready to use at the tenancy level.
- **OCI VCN and Subnets** Lift team will check the existing VCN and subnets and create new ones if needed.
- **Bastion Service**  will be used by the Oracle Lift team to have external access to VCNs
- **NAT Gateway** -A NAT gateway enables private resources in a VCN to access hosts on the internet, without exposing those resources to incoming internet connections. It will be used for OCI Data integration and BICC.
- **Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)** is the virtual router that secures and manages traffic between on-premises networks and Virtual Cloud Networks (VCN) in Oracle Cloud.
- **Service Gateways** allow private access to Oracle managed services with public IP addresses from on-premises and from VCNs, without exposing the traffic to the public Internet.
- **Virtual Cloud Networks (VCN) and Subnets** will contain private resources like computing instances, database systems, and private endpoints for Oracle managed resources like Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Analytics Cloud.

#### Network Firewall

Optionally a managed Network Firewall can be leveraged to increase security posture of the workload.

OCI Network Firewall is a next-generation managed network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for VCNs, powered by Palo Alto Networks®. The Network Firewall service offers simple setup and deployment and gives visibility into traffic entering the cloud environment (North-south network traffic) as well traffic between subnets (East-west network traffic).

Use network firewall and its advanced features together with other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure security services to create a layered network security solution.

A network firewall is a highly available and scalable instance that you create in the subnet of your choice. The firewall applies business logic to traffic that is specified in an attached firewall policy. Routing in the VCN is used to direct network traffic to and from the firewall.

![Network Firewall deployment example](assets/network-firewall-drg.png)

Above a simple example is presented where a Network Firewall is deployed in a DMZ subnet and for which all incoming traffic via the DRG as well as all the outgoing traffic from the private subnet is routed to the Network Firewall so that policies are enforced to secure traffic.

The design considerations for an OCI Cloud Landing Zone have to do with OCI and industry architecture best practices, along with customer specific architecture requirements that reflect the Cloud Strategy (hybrid, multi-cloud, etc). An OCI Cloud Landing zone involves a variety of fundamental aspects that have a broad level of sophistication. A good summary of a Cloud Landing Zone has been published by [Cap Gemini](https://www.capgemini.com/2019/06/cloud-landing-zone-the-best-practices-for-every-cloud/).

### Resource Naming Convention
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
If the customer provides a resource naming convention use it. They should have it already for their on-premises compute resources.
-->

Oracle recommends the following Resource Naming Convention:

- The name segments are separated by “-“
- Within a name segment avoid using <space> and “.”
- Where possible intuitive/standard abbreviations should be considered (e.g. “shared“ compared to "shared.cloud.team”)
- When referring to the compartment full path, use “:” as separator, e.g. cmp-shared:cmp-security

Some examples of naming are given below:

- cmp-shared
- cmp-\<workload>
- cmp-networking

The patterns used are these:

- \<resource-type>-\<environment>-\<location>-\<purpose>
- \<resource-type>-\<environment>-\<source-location>-\<destination-location>-\<purpose>
- \<resource-type>-\<entity/sub-entity>-\<environment>-\<function/department>-\<project>-\<custom>
- \<resource-type>-\<environment>-\<location>-\<purpose>

Abbreviation per resource type are listed below. This list may not be complete.

| Resource type | Abbreviation | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Bastion Service | bst | bst-\<location>-\<network> |
| Block Volume | blk | blk-\<location>-\<project>-\<purpose>
| Compartment | cmp | cmp-shared, cmp-shared-security |
| Customer Premise Equipment | cpe | cpe-\<location>-\<destination> |
| DNS Endpoint Forwarder | dnsepf | dnsepf-\<location> |
| DNS Endpoint Listener | dnsepl | dnsepl-\<location> |
| Dynamic Group | dgp | dpg-security-functions |
| Dynamic Routing Gateway | drg | drg-prod-\<location>
| Dynamic Routing Gateway Attachment | drgatt | drgatt-prod-\<location>-\<source_vcn>-\<destination_vcn> |
| Fast Connect | fc# <# := 1...n> | fc0-\<location>-\<destination> |

| NAT Gateway | nat | nat-prod-\<location>-\<project> |
| Network Security Group | nsg | nsg-prod-\<location>-waf |
| Managed key | key | key-prod-\<location>-\<project>-database01 |

| Tenancy | tc | tc |
| Vault | vlt | vlt-\<location> |
| Virtual Cloud Network | vcn | vcn-\<location> |
| Virtual Machine | vm | vm-xxxx |
| | | |

**Note:** Resource names are limited to 100 characters.

#### Group Names

OCI Group Names should follow the naming scheme of the Enterprise Identity Management system for Groups or Roles.

Examples for global groups are:

- \<prefix>-\<purpose>-admins
- \<prefix>-\<purpose>-users

For departmental groups:

- \<prefix>-\<compartment>-\<purpose>-admins
- \<prefix>-\<compartment>-\<purpose>-users

The value for \<prefix> or the full names **must be agreed** with customer.

### Security and Identity Management

This chapter covers the Security and Identity Management definitions and resources which will be implemented for customer.

#### Universal Security and Identity and Access Management Principles

- Groups will be configured at the tenancy level and access will be governed by policies configured in OCI.
- Any new project deployment in OCI will start with the creation of a new compartment. Compartments follow a hierarchy, and the compartment structure will be decided as per the application requirements.
- It is also proposed to keep any shared resources, such as Object Storage, Networks etc. in a shared services compartment. This will allow the various resources in different compartments to access and use the resources deployed in the shared services compartment and user access can be controlled by policies related to specific resource types and user roles.
- Policies will be configured in OCI to maintain the level of access / control that should exist between resources in different compartments. These will also control user access to the various resources deployed in the tenancy.
- The tenancy will include a pre-provisioned Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) instance (the primary IDCS instance) or, where applicable, the Default Identity Domain. Both provide access management across all Oracle cloud services for IaaS, PaaS and SaaS cloud offerings.
- The primary IDCS or the Default Identity Domain will be used as the access management system for all users administrating (OCI Administrators) the OCI tenant.

#### Authentication and Authorization for OCI

Provisioning of respective OCI administration users will be handled by the customer.

##### User Management

Only OCI Administrators are granted access to the OCI Infrastructure. As a good practice, these users are managed within the pre-provisioned and pre-integrated Oracle Identity Cloud Service (primary IDCS) or, where applicable, the OCI Default Identity Domain, of OCI tenancy. These users are members of groups. IDCS Groups can be mapped to OCI groups while Identity Domains groups do not require any mapping. Each mapped group membership will be considered during login.

**Local Users**

The usage of OCI Local Users is not recommended for the majority of users and is restricted to a few users only. These users include the initial OCI Administrator created during the tenancy setup, and additional emergency administrators.

**Local Users are considered as Emergency Administrators and should not be used for daily administration activities!**

**No additional users are to be, nor should be, configured as local users.**

**The customer is responsible to manage and maintain local users for emergency use cases.**

**Federated Users**

Unlike Local Users, Federated Users are managed in the Federated or Enterprise User Management system. In the OCI User list Federated Users may be distinguished by a prefix which consists of the name of the federated service in lower case, a '/' character followed by the user name of the federated user, for example:

`oracleidentityservicecloud/user@example.com`

In order to provide the same attributes (OCI API Keys, Auth Tokens, Customer Secret Keys, OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials, and SMTP Credentials) for Local and *Federated Users* federation with third-party Identity Providers should only be done in the pre-configured primary IDCS or the Default Identity Domain where applicable.

All users have the same OCI-specific attributes (OCI API Keys, Auth Tokens, Customer Secret Keys, OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials, and SMTP Credentials).

OCI Administration user should only be configured in the pre-configured primary IDCS or the Default Identity Domain where applicable.

**Note:** Any federated user can be a member of 100 groups only. The OCI Console limits the number of groups in a SAML assertion to 100 groups. User Management in the Enterprise Identity Management system will be handled by the customer.

**Authorization**

In general, policies hold permissions granted to groups. Policy and Group naming follows the Resource Naming Conventions.

**Tenant Level Authorization**

The policies and groups defined at the tenant level will provide access to administrators and authorized users, to manage or view resources across the entire tenancy. Tenant level authorization will be granted to tenant administrators only.

These policies follow the recommendations of the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark v1.1.0, recommendations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

**Service Policy**

A Service Policy is used to enable services at the tenancy level. It is not assigned to any group.

**Shared Compartment Authorization**

Compartment level authorization for the cmp-shared compartment structure uses the following specific policies and groups.

Apart from tenant level authorization, authorization for the cmp-shared compartment provides specific policies and groups. In general, policies will be designed that lower-level compartments are not able to modify resources of higher-level compartments.

Policies for the cmp-shared compartment follow the recommendations of the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark v1.1.0, recommendations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

**Compartment Level Authorization**

Apart from tenant level authorization, compartment level authorization provides compartment structure specific policies and groups. In general, policies will be designed that lower-level compartments are not able to modify resources of higher-level compartments.

**Authentication and Authorization for Applications and Databases**

Application (including Compute Instances) and Database User management is completely separate of and done outside of the primary IDCS or Default Identity Domain. The management of these users is the sole responsibility of the customer using the application, compute instance and database specific authorization.

#### Security Posture Management

**Oracle Cloud Guard**

Oracle Cloud Guard Service will be enabled using the pcy-service policy and with the following default configuration. Customization of the Detector and Responder Recipes will result in clones of the default (Oracle Managed) recipes.

Cloud Guard default configuration provides a number of good settings. It is expected that these settings may not match with the customer's requirements.

**Targets**

In accordance with the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.15](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks), Cloud Guard will be enabled in the root compartment.

**Detectors**

The Oracle Default Configuration Detector Recipes and Oracle Default Activity Detector Recipes are implemented. To better meet the requirements, the default detectors must be cloned and configured by the customer.

**Responder Rules**

The default Cloud Guard Responders will be implemented. To better meet the requirements, the default detectors must be cloned and configured by the customer.

**Vulnerability Scanning Service**

In accordance with the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, OCI Vulnerability Scanning](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) will be enabled using the pcy-service policy.

Compute instances which should be scanned *must* implement the *Oracle Cloud Agent* and enable the *Vulnerability Scanning plugin*.

**OCI OS Management Service**

Required policy statements for OCI OS Management Service are included in the pcy-service policy.

By default, the *OS Management Service Agent plugin* of the *Oracle Cloud Agent* is enabled and running on current Oracle Linux 6 and Oracle Linux 7 platform images.

#### Monitoring, Auditing and Logging

In accordance with the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3 Logging and Monitoring](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) the following configurations will be made:

- OCI Audit log retention period set to 365 days. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.1](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- At least one notification topic and subscription to receive monitoring alerts. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.3](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for Identity Provider changes. [See CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.4](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for IdP group mapping changes. [See CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.5](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for IAM policy changes. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.6](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)

- Notification for user changes. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.8](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for VCN changes. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.9](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for changes to route tables. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.10](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for security list changes. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.11](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for network security group changes. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.12](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for changes to network gateways. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.13](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- VCN flow logging for all subnets. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.14](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Write level logging for all Object Storage Buckets. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.17](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for Cloud Guard detected problems.
- Notification for Cloud Guard remedied problems.

For IDCS or OCI Identity Domain Auditing events, the respective Auditing API can be used to retrieve all required information.

#### Data Encryption

All data will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Encryption keys can be managed by Oracle or the customer and will be implemented for identified resources.

##### Key Management
<!--
Make sure that the correct type of the vault is used:
shared - cheap to moderate pricing
private - expensive pricing
-->

All keys for **OCI Block Volume**, **OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes**, **OCI Database**, **OCI File Storage**, **OCI Object Storage**, and **OCI Streaming** are centrally managed in a shared or a private virtual vault will be implemented and placed in the compartment cmp-security.

**Object Storage Security**

For Object Storage security the following guidelines are considered.

- **Access to Buckets** -- Assign least privileged access for IAM users and groups to resource types in the object-family (Object Storage Buckets & Object)
- **Encryption at rest** -- All data in the Object Storage is encrypted at rest using AES-256 and is on by default. This cannot be turned off and objects are encrypted with a master encryption key.

**Data Residency**

It is expected that data will be held in the respective region and additional steps will be taken when exporting the data to other regions to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. This should be review for every project onboard into the tenancy.

#### Operational Security

**Security Zones**

Whenever possible OCI Security Zones will be used to implement a security compartment for Compute instances or Database resources. For more information on Security Zones refer to the in the *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure User Guide* chapter on [Security Zones](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/security-zone/using/security-zones.htm).

**Remote Access to Compute Instances or Private Database Endpoints**

To allow remote access to Compute Instances or Private Database Endpoints, the OCI Bastion will be implemented for defined compartments.

To be able to use OCI services to for OS management, Vulnerability Scanning, Bastion Service, etc. it is highly recommended to implement the Oracle Cloud Agent as documented in the *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure User Guide* chapter [Managing Plugins with Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm).

#### Network Time Protocol Configuration for Compute Instance

Synchronized clocks are a necessity for securely operating environments. OCI provides a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server using the OCI global IP number 169.254.169.254. All compute instances should be configured to use this NTP service.

#### Regulations and Compliance

The customer is responsible for setting the access rules to services and environments that require stakeholders’ integration to the tenancy to comply with all applicable regulations. Oracle will support in accomplishing this task.

| :-----                     | :-----------              | :-------          | :------     | :------|

| **PROD**               | OCI Data Integration - Pipeline Operator Execution  |   |**TBD**  |    |

| **PROD** | Network Firewall (optional) - B95403 |  |**TBD** | |


The sizing defined above is the recommended sizing from Oracle team to accommodate the expected volume of data and meet the scalability of the predicted data processing; since the OCI services can be scaled up and scaled down the customer can always revisit this sizing in the future and adjust it as needed.

* (1) With Autoscaling enabled, ADW will automatically scale to 3x time of base OCPUs. With 1 OCPU, it can scale up to 3 OCPUs. We recommend enabling Autoscaling for production workloads.
* (2) For OAC, 1 OCPU is recommended for Trials only. OAC instances with 1 OCPU are restricted in how many rows they may return (see https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/analytics-cloud/doc/create-services.html for details.

## Deployment Build
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
The Deployment Build is a list of all OCI resources needed for the Lift implementation. It serves two purposes: as a customers documentation; and as a Lift implementer handover. The checklist below defines mandatory requirements as per project scope for the Lift implementation. This table replaces the CD3 file for the architecture team.

Agile Approach: The architect creates and fills in the first version of this table. We work together with our customers to get and confirm the detailed data. Afterwards, the architect and the implementer are working together to iteratively fill these tables. In the meantime some development might already been done by the implementers.

RACI: The architect is Accountable and Responsible for this section. The implementer will actively Consult to provide missing data.

Automatic Parsing: This section is going to be automatically parsed by the implementers. As architects, please try to avoid changing the sub-section names or table structures and attributes. Change only with a strong need, and let me (Alexander Hodicke) know if you need a change here. In addition, please put a comment around each table as seen in the example below - Do not delete them.

For all sub-chapters:

Mandatory Chapter (Partly Optional: If part of your solution / Some subchapters might be mutual exclusive.)

### Phase 1: <name>
<!-- Guidance -->
<!--
Please group the Deployment Build into phases depending on the size of the engagement. Each chapter of the Deployment Build belongs to a phase and represents an iterative implementation. First we implement phase 1 and we need to collect data here for that phase. Rearrange the chapters to fit to the right phases. An implementation could have as many phases as needed, and if it has just one, do not group it into just a single phase.
