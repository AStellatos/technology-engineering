# Data Transforms
 
Oracle Data Transforms is an Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) based integration tool that can be deployed from Oracle Cloud Marketplace. It provides a fully unified solution for building, deploying, and managing complex data warehouses or as part of data- centric architectures in a SOA or business intelligence environment. 
In addition, it combines all the elements of data integration - data movement, data synchronization, data quality, and data management - to ensure that information is timely, accurate, and consistent across complex systems. Oracle Data Transforms integrates with Oracle Autonomous Database (Autonomous Data Warehouse and Autonomous Transaction Processing) for repository creation as well as for loading data directly into ADB or ATP.
