The scope of this project is to deliver a working **Test environment including one deployment of Essbase 21c marketplace** in OCI.

Customer's on-premises Essbase deployments can be migrated to run on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure without requiring significant configuration, integration, or process changes. The resulting implementation will be more flexible and more reliable than on-premises or other cloud deployments. Oracle has a validated solution to accomplish these goals, quickly and reliably. This solution includes procedures, supporting Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platform services, and reference architectures. These consider real production needs, like security, network configuration, disaster recovery (DR), identity integration, and cost management.

By moving Essbase systems to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure the following benefits could be realized:

1. Lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than on-premises deployments
2. Managing and reducing CAPEX, and ensuring that the data centers you maintain are efficient, while eliminating server hardware, and taking advantage of cloud flexibility where possible
3. Rapid in-place technology refresh
4. Proactive monitoring of usage and costs
5. Scaling up or down to handle business growth or workload bursts

## Workload Business Value
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
A clear statement of specific business value as part of the full workload scope. Try to keep it SMART: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-Related - Agree the SMART business value with the customer. Keep it business focused, and speak the language of the LOB which benefits from this Workload: "Increase Customer Retention by 3% in the next year" or "Grow Customer Base with Executive Decision-Making from our Sales and Support Data". Avoid technical success criteria such as "Migrate App X to Oracle Cloud" or "Provision 5 Compute Instances". Avoid Oracle success criteria and language "Get Workload Consuming on OCI".

The current project includes provisioning of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure infrastructure and deploying Essbase 21c via MarketPlace.
This project also involves the migration of two Essbase applications from version 11.1.2.4 currently hosted on-premises and used by the customer.

The customer has 2 Essbase environments currently:

| Environment     | Description |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| PROD   | 1 single server deployed on Windows 2012 R2 STD with MS SQL Server  |
| DEV    | 1 single server deployed on Windows 2012 R2 STD with MS SQL Server   |


## Functional Requirements
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Provide a brief overview of the functional requirements, the functional area they belong to, the impacted business processes, etc.

Provide a formal description of the requirements as 1. a set of Use Cases or 2. a description of Functional Capabilities or 3. a Requirement Matrix. The three descriptions are not mutually exclusive.

Some Workload team, especially the Analytics and Merging Tech teams, will create new application based on functional requirements, some Workload team will not touch the functional requirements at all and just change the platform under an application. But it is important to understand who is using the system and for what reason.

Oracle Essbase is a business analytics solution that uses a proven, flexible, best-in-class architecture for analysis, reporting, and collaboration. Oracle Essbase delivers instant value and greater productivity for your business users, analysts, modelers, and decision-makers, across all lines of business within your organization.

Oracle Essbase provides a complete set of tools and features for deriving and sharing data insights.
Oracle Essbase on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) via Marketplace is a powerful analytic platform with robust new features added since Release 11g.

However, as part of the workload migration project, no functional changes are implemented to the Essbase applications. Please refer to official documentation for differences between Essbase 11g and Essbase 21c [here] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/essbase/21/essoa/differences-essbase-11g-and-essbase-21c.html)


### Functional Capabilities
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
In specific cases, a set of Functional Capabilities can be represented in a Functional Decomposition Diagram. This is typical of Functional Analysis in System Engineering domain. For more information on Functional Analysis see, e.g. https://spacese.spacegrant.org/functional-analysis/.

Oracle Essbase stands for Extended Spread Sheet Database. Essbase is an OLAP (On-line Analytic Processing) business analysis server technology that provides an environment for rapidly developing custom analytic applications, uses complex queries to analyze aggregated historical data from OLTP systems. Multidimensional analysis uses a database that is structured on business concepts and that is designed around business needs.

In addition, Essbase is built on middle tier application server (Weblogic) and DB tier.
Further information can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/essbase/21/essst/what-is-oracle-essbase.html)


### Requirement Matrix
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
A Requirement Matrix can be used when the solution will be based on software capabilities already available in existing components (either custom or vendor provided). The Requirements Matrix is a matrix that is used to capture client requirements for software selection and to evaluate the initial functional “fit” of a vendor’s software solution to the business needs
of the client.

For example, rows can list required functional capabilities and columns can list available software components. Cells can contain a simple Y/N or provide more detail. The Requirements Matrix also is used to identify initial functional gaps or special software enhancements needed to enable each vendor’s software to fulfill the client’s desired system capabilities.

This section captures all the non-functional requirements of the workload migration project.

### Integration and Interfaces
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
A list of all the interfaces into and out of the defined Workload. The list should detail the type of integration, the type connectivity required (e.g. VPN, VPC etc) the volumes and the frequency
- list of integrations
- list of user interfaces


-->

This table lists the existing integrations/Interfaces with current Essbase On-Premises deployment.

**TBC BY THE CUSTOMER**


**The integrations/Interfaces are out of scope of the workload. No connectivity will be implemented with OnPremises Enterprise Applications for the Test environment for integration.**

### Regulations and Compliances
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
This section captures and specific regulatory of compliance requirements for the Workload. These may limit the types of technologies that can be used and may drive some architectural decisions.

If there are none, then please state None.


-->

At the time of this document creation, no Regulatory and Compliance requirements have been specified.

For documentation purpose, the list of frameworks for which an Oracle line of business has achieved a third-party attestation or certification for one or more of its services is public available on [Oracle Cloud Compliance](https://www.oracle.com/ae/corporate/cloud-compliance/) .

### Environments
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
A diagram or list detailing all the required environments (e.g. development, text, live, production etc).
- list each environment included in the scope
- map each environment to bronze/silver/gold MAA


-->

The following table lists all the environments (current + required) as part of the workload project. The scope column mentions whether the environment is included in the workload migration project scope or not.

| Name       | Size of Prod | Customer DC/ OCI Region | MAA | Scope        |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------|-----|--------------|
| Production | 100%         | Customer DC             | NA  | Not in Scope |
| DEV        | 25%          | Customer DC             | NA  | Not in Scope |
| Test       | **50%**      | Amsterdam               | NA  | Workload     |

### System Configuration Control Lifecycle
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
This section should detail the requirements for the development and deployment lifecycle across the Workload. This details how code will be deployed and how consistency across the environments will be maintained over future software deployment. This may include a need for CI/CD.
- will a CI/CD tool need access to deploy to the target environment
- does the customer require software to be delivered to a repository
- how will configuration and software be promoted through the environments



Oracle recommends the below approach to automate continuous delivery onto servers running on OCI for customer’s application:

- Git version management
- Automating deployment
- Automate LCM export

More details on automating the Infrastructure deployments on OCI for Hyperion reference architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-essbase).

More information on automating the Essbase installation can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/essbase/21/essst/how-do-i-get-started.html).
-->

### Resilience and Recovery
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
This section captures the resilience and recovery requirements for the Workload. Note that these may be different from the current system.

The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirement of each environment should be captured in the environments section above, and wherever possible, these should be mapped to the standard Bronze, Silver and Gold levels of Oracle's MAA.

- What are RTO and RPO requirements of the Application?
- What are SLA's of the application?
- What are the backup requirements

Note that if needed, this section may also include an overview of the proposed backup and disaster recovery proposed architectures.

This chapter is mandatory, while there could be no requirements on HA/DR, please mention that in a short single sentence.


-->

The following table captures the RPO and RTO requirements of each of the environments for the workload.

Environment  |RPO   |RTO
--|---|--
TEST  | 24 Hours  |  4 Hours

**Backup requirements:**

Current Backup Schedule:

Currently, Essbase is backed up with some backup scripts once every day. Incremental backups once every day and log backups once every hour.

OCI Backup Requirements:

Essbase backup and restore planning is required at both the application and instance level to have full flexibility to manage the life cycle of the Essbase instances, and also to provide disaster recovery.

Backups of individual applications protect you from application failures or application artifact corruption, and can easily be migrated between servers. When you restore a single application, there is no disruption to user activity with other applications in your instance. Essbase application backups are taken using LCM export and import commands.

Use Essbase instance backups to restore all applications on your instance to a common point in time. Instance backups are primarily for disaster recovery, but are also appropriate when you want to migrate or restore all applications at once. Backups of Essbase on OCI depend on some details of the Essbase stack. A complete backup must protect all information that makes your Essbase deployment unique. Items you may be instructed to back up include:

* Relational database schemas which store some application, user and configuration information.
* Essbase application and database information stored on a block volume mounted as /u01/data.
* WebLogic domain and configuration information stored** on a block volume mounted as /u01/confg.

### Operating Model
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
This section captures requirements on how the system will be managed after implementation and migration. In the vast majority of cases, the solution will be handed back to the customer (or the customer's SI/partner), but in some cases, Oracle may also take on some sustaining responsibilities through ACS or OC

Also capture requirements for tools to monitor and manage the solution.


-->

The workload migration will be implemented by Customer/Partner/Oracle Consulting or a combination of these. Post implementation, the Hyperion environments in scope of the project will be handed over to the customer/partner/Oracle ACS team as agreed with the customer. Customer/Partner/Oracle ACS team will be responsible for managing and maintaining the Hyperion workload and OCI post implementation.

### Management and Monitoring
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
This subsection captures any requirements for integrations into the customer's existing management and monitoring systems - e.g. system monitoring, systems management etc. Also, if the customer requires new management or monitor capabilities, these should also be recorded.


-->

OCI can provide metrics automatically for many of the native resources. There is no need to install an agent on a block storage volume or VCN, as these resources will emit predefined metrics on their own.

The following table lists all the different kinds of metrics and logs that can be collected and used in monitoring the proposed solution:

| **Components**     | **Logs/Metrics** | **Agent Based** | **Types of data**                                                                                  |

Oracle recommends leveraging Oracle Management Cloud which provides integrated monitoring across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It performs monitoring through use of agents across various tiers from infrastructure to application performance, security, and even end-user activity. It also integrates with Oracle Enterprise Manager for Oracle Database performance and capacity analytics.

### Performance
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
The performance requirements cover all aspects related to the time required to perform a given operation. They can be measured in different ways, for example: (1) AvrgTime: average response time that can be accepted for a given online or real interactions (data retrieve, data insert, etc.) (2) MaxTime: maximum response time for the same operations defined for AvrgRtime The operations can be online (user interactions), offline (batch execution) or (near)realtime (messaging).

### Capacity
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Capacity is a measure of the total workload the system can bear without affecting performance. There are many KPIs to measure capacity, depending on the system functionalities. Some of the most relevant KPIs are:
(1) MaxVol: maximum volume of data that can be stored in the system (can be different for different types of data, e.g. relational and file): **800-900GB** current database size (probably with significant waste of space)
(2) MaxFlow: maximum data flow (input/output) that can be managed by the system (can be two different numbers for each major system interface and/or operation): the current value has not been measured but is expected to be **at most a few GB.**
(3) MaxUser: maximum number of concurrent users (can be differentiated by user profile): up to **10 (number of registered users)**.

Recommended Chapter
-->

<!-- EXAMPLE / TEMPLATE -->
The following table indicates the current sizing available onpremises and also outlines any additional capacity requested by the customer or required for the workload migration to OCI. Incase of 1:1 sizing and no performance issues/growth considerations, the current capacity will be matched on OCI.

### Security
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Capture the non functional requirements for security related topics. Security is a mandatory subsection which is to be reviewed by the x-workload security team. The requirements can be separated into:
- Identity and Access Management
- Data Security

Other security topics, such as network security, application security or other can be added if needed.

Mandatory Chapter
-->

This section captures the security requirements from the customers for this workload:

* No Corporate Directory integration for Essbase on OCI
* SSL Offloading required for HTTPS access for end-users


#### Identity and Access Management
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
The requirements for identity and access control. This section describes any requirements for
authentication, identity management, single-sign-on and necessary integrations to retained customer systems
(e.g. corporate directories)
- Is there any Single Sign On or Active Directory Integration Requirement?
- Is the OS hardened if so please share the hardening guide line?


-->

OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the access control plane for OCI and Oracle Cloud Applications. It’s the OCI-native authentication service and policy engine for OCI services that has been used to manage access to OCI resources such as networking, compute, storage, and analytics.
OCI IAM uses identity domains to provide identity and access management features such as authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and identity lifecycle management for Oracle Cloud as well as for Oracle and non-Oracle applications, whether SaaS, cloud hosted, or on premises.

Currently there isn't a requirement to federate users for this workload.

Temporary access to customer’s OCI tenancy will be available to the implementation team for their scope detailed later in this document. OCI implementation will adopt the tenet of no access by default and least privilege for any access configured.

#### Data Security
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Capture any specific or special requirements for data security. This section should also describe any additional constraints such as a requirement for data to be held in a specific locations or for data export restrictions

Recommended Chapter
-->

## Constraints and Risks
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
Constraints are limitations which will impact the resulting project or Solution Architecture. It is a technology- or project-related condition or event that prevents the project from fully delivering the ideal solution to customers and end-users. Constraints can be identified on our customer, partner or even Oracle's side.

A project risk is an uncertain event that may or may not occur during a project.

Describe constraints and risks affecting the Workload and possible Logical Solution Architecture. These can be of technical nature, but might also be non-technical. Consider: budgets, timing, preferred technologies, skills in the customer organization, location, etc.

Based on the customer requirements, the future state logical architecture of Essbase on OCI is depicted below.

![Future Logical Architecture](images/future-functional-diagram-oci.png)

The main building blocks that compose this cloud architecture:

* __Essbase 21c__: The targeted version of Essbase on OCI will be Essbase 21C (21.3). Essbase 21c will be deployed via Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace.

* Database for Essbase metadata: Autonomous Database using the __Autonomous Transaction Processing workload__ (ATP). ATP is proposed to evaluate exclusive functionalities for federated partitions. ATP is a managed database integrated with Object Storage and optimized for analytical queries. Federated partitions enable to integrate Essbase cubes with Autonomous Data Warehouse, to combine Essbase's analytical power with the benefits of Autonomous Database.

The design considerations for an OCI Cloud Landing Zone have to do with OCI and industry architecture best practices, along with customer specific architecture requirements that reflect the Cloud Strategy (hybrid, multi-cloud, etc). An OCI Cloud Landing zone involves a variety of fundamental aspects that have a broad level of sophistication. A good summary of a Cloud Landing Zone has been published by [link](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/technology-implementation.htm).

### Resource Naming Convention
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
If the customer provides a resource naming convention use it. They should have it already for their on-premises compute resources.
-->

Oracle recommends the following Resource Naming Convention:

- The name segments are separated by “-“
- Within a name segment avoid using <space> and “.”
- Where possible intuitive/standard abbreviations should be considered (e.g. “shared“ compared to "shared.cloud.team”)
- When referring to the compartment full path, use “:” as separator, e.g. cmp-shared:cmp-security

Some examples of naming are given below:

- cmp-shared
- cmp-\<workload>
- cmp-networking

The patterns used are these:

- \<resource-type>-\<environment>-\<location>-\<purpose>
- \<resource-type>-\<environment>-\<source-location>-\<destination-location>-\<purpose>
- \<resource-type>-\<entity/sub-entity>-\<environment>-\<function/department>-\<project>-\<custom>
- \<resource-type>-\<environment>-\<location>-\<purpose>

Abbreviation per resource type are listed below. This list may not be complete.

| Resource type | Abbreviation | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Bastion Service | bst | bst-\<location>-\<network> |
| Block Volume | blk | blk-\<location>-\<project>-\<purpose>
| Compartment | cmp | cmp-shared, cmp-shared-security |
| Customer Premise Equipment | cpe | cpe-\<location>-\<destination> |
| DNS Endpoint Forwarder | dnsepf | dnsepf-\<location> |
| DNS Endpoint Listener | dnsepl | dnsepl-\<location> |
| Dynamic Group | dgp | dpg-security-functions |
| Dynamic Routing Gateway | drg | drg-prod-\<location>
| Dynamic Routing Gateway Attachment | drgatt | drgatt-prod-\<location>-\<source_vcn>-\<destination_vcn> |

**Note:** Resource names are limited to 100 characters.

#### Group Names

OCI Group Names should follow the naming scheme of the Enterprise Identity Management system for Groups or Roles.

Examples for global groups are:

- \<prefix>-\<purpose>-admins
- \<prefix>-\<purpose>-users

For departmental groups:

- \<prefix>-\<compartment>-\<purpose>-admins
- \<prefix>-\<compartment>-\<purpose>-users

The value for \<prefix> or the full names **must be agreed** with customer.

### Security and Identity Management

This chapter covers the Security and Identity Management definitions and resources which will be implemented for customer.

#### Universal Security and Identity and Access Management Principles

- Groups will be configured at the tenancy level and access will be governed by policies configured in OCI.
- Any new project deployment in OCI will start with the creation of a new compartment. Compartments follow a hierarchy, and the compartment structure will be decided as per the application requirements.
- It is also proposed to keep any shared resources, such as Object Storage, Networks etc. in a shared services compartment. This will allow the various resources in different compartments to access and use the resources deployed in the shared services compartment and user access can be controlled by policies related to specific resource types and user roles.
- Policies will be configured in OCI to maintain the level of access / control that should exist between resources in different compartments. These will also control user access to the various resources deployed in the tenancy.
- The tenancy will include a pre-provisioned Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) instance (the primary IDCS instance) or, where applicable, the Default Identity Domain. Both provide access management across all Oracle cloud services for IaaS, PaaS and SaaS cloud offerings.
- The primary IDCS or the Default Identity Domain will be used as the access management system for all users administrating (OCI Administrators) the OCI tenant.

#### Authentication and Authorization for OCI

Provisioning of respective OCI administration users will be handled by the customer.

##### User Management

Only OCI Administrators are granted access to the OCI Infrastructure. As a good practice, these users are managed within the pre-provisioned and pre-integrated Oracle Identity Cloud Service (primary IDCS) or, where applicable, the OCI Default Identity Domain, of OCI tenancy. These users are members of groups. IDCS Groups can be mapped to OCI groups while Identity Domains groups do not require any mapping. Each mapped group membership will be considered during login.

**Local Users**

The usage of OCI Local Users is not recommended for the majority of users and is restricted to a few users only. These users include the initial OCI Administrator created during the tenancy setup, and additional emergency administrators.

**Local Users are considered as Emergency Administrators and should not be used for daily administration activities!**

**No additional users are to be, nor should be, configured as local users.**

**The customer is responsible to manage and maintain local users for emergency use cases.**

**Federated Users**

Unlike Local Users, Federated Users are managed in the Federated or Enterprise User Management system. In the OCI User list Federated Users may be distinguished by a prefix which consists of the name of the federated service in lower case, a '/' character followed by the user name of the federated user, for example:

`oracleidentityservicecloud/user@example.com`

In order to provide the same attributes (OCI API Keys, Auth Tokens, Customer Secret Keys, OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials, and SMTP Credentials) for Local and *Federated Users* federation with third-party Identity Providers should only be done in the pre-configured primary IDCS or the Default Identity Domain where applicable.

All users have the same OCI-specific attributes (OCI API Keys, Auth Tokens, Customer Secret Keys, OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials, and SMTP Credentials).

OCI Administration user should only be configured in the pre-configured primary IDCS or the Default Identity Domain where applicable.

**Note:** Any federated user can be a member of 100 groups only. The OCI Console limits the number of groups in a SAML assertion to 100 groups. User Management in the Enterprise Identity Management system will be handled by the customer.

**Authorization**

In general, policies hold permissions granted to groups. Policy and Group naming follows the Resource Naming Conventions.

**Tenant Level Authorization**

The policies and groups defined at the tenant level will provide access to administrators and authorized users, to manage or view resources across the entire tenancy. Tenant level authorization will be granted to tenant administrators only.

These policies follow the recommendations of the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark v1.1.0, recommendations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

**Service Policy**

A Service Policy is used to enable services at the tenancy level. It is not assigned to any group.

**Shared Compartment Authorization**

Compartment level authorization for the cmp-shared compartment structure uses the following specific policies and groups.

Apart from tenant level authorization, authorization for the cmp-shared compartment provides specific policies and groups. In general, policies will be designed that lower-level compartments are not able to modify resources of higher-level compartments.

Policies for the cmp-shared compartment follow the recommendations of the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark v1.1.0, recommendations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

**Compartment Level Authorization**

Apart from tenant level authorization, compartment level authorization provides compartment structure specific policies and groups. In general, policies will be designed that lower-level compartments are not able to modify resources of higher-level compartments.

**Authentication and Authorization for Applications and Databases**

Application (including Compute Instances) and Database User management is completely separate of and done outside of the primary IDCS or Default Identity Domain. The management of these users is the sole responsibility of the customer using the application, compute instance and database specific authorization.

#### Security Posture Management

**Oracle Cloud Guard**

Oracle Cloud Guard Service will be enabled using the pcy-service policy and with the following default configuration. Customization of the Detector and Responder Recipes will result in clones of the default (Oracle Managed) recipes.

Cloud Guard default configuration provides a number of good settings. It is expected that these settings may not match with the customer's requirements.

**Targets**

In accordance with the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.15](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks), Cloud Guard will be enabled in the root compartment.

**Detectors**

The Oracle Default Configuration Detector Recipes and Oracle Default Activity Detector Recipes are implemented. To better meet the requirements, the default detectors must be cloned and configured by the customer.

**Responder Rules**

The default Cloud Guard Responders will be implemented. To better meet the requirements, the default detectors must be cloned and configured by the customer.

**Vulnerability Scanning Service**

In accordance with the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, OCI Vulnerability Scanning](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) will be enabled using the pcy-service policy.

Compute instances which should be scanned *must* implement the *Oracle Cloud Agent* and enable the *Vulnerability Scanning plugin*.

**OCI OS Management Service**

Required policy statements for OCI OS Management Service are included in the pcy-service policy.

By default, the *OS Management Service Agent plugin* of the *Oracle Cloud Agent* is enabled and running on current Oracle Linux 6 and Oracle Linux 7 platform images.

#### Monitoring, Auditing and Logging

In accordance with the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3 Logging and Monitoring](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) the following configurations will be made:

- OCI Audit log retention period set to 365 days. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.1](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- At least one notification topic and subscription to receive monitoring alerts. See [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.3](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
- Notification for Identity Provider changes. [See CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations Benchmark, v1.1.0, Chapter 3.4](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)

- Notification for Cloud Guard detected problems.
- Notification for Cloud Guard remedied problems.

For IDCS or OCI Identity Domain Auditing events, the respective Auditing API can be used to retrieve all required information.

#### Data Encryption

All data will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Encryption keys can be managed by Oracle or the customer and will be implemented for identified resources.

##### Key Management
<!--
Make sure that the correct type of the vault is used:
shared - cheap to moderate pricing
private - expensive pricing
-->

All keys for **OCI Block Volume**, **OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes**, **OCI Database**, **OCI File Storage**, **OCI Object Storage**, and **OCI Streaming** are centrally managed in a shared or a private virtual vault will be implemented and placed in the compartment cmp-security.

**Object Storage Security**

For Object Storage security the following guidelines are considered.

- **Access to Buckets** -- Assign least privileged access for IAM users and groups to resource types in the object-family (Object Storage Buckets & Object)
- **Encryption at rest** -- All data in the Object Storage is encrypted at rest using AES-256 and is on by default. This cannot be turned off and objects are encrypted with a master encryption key.

**Data Residency**

It is expected that data will be held in the respective region and additional steps will be taken when exporting the data to other regions to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. This should be review for every project onboard into the tenancy.

#### Operational Security

**Security Zones**

Whenever possible OCI Security Zones will be used to implement a security compartment for Compute instances or Database resources. For more information on Security Zones refer to the in the *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure User Guide* chapter on [Security Zones](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/security-zone/using/security-zones.htm).

**Remote Access to Compute Instances or Private Database Endpoints**

To allow remote access to Compute Instances or Private Database Endpoints, the OCI Bastion will be implemented for defined compartments.

To be able to use OCI services to for OS management, Vulnerability Scanning, Bastion Service, etc. it is highly recommended to implement the Oracle Cloud Agent as documented in the *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure User Guide* chapter [Managing Plugins with Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm).

#### Network Time Protocol Configuration for Compute Instance

Synchronized clocks are a necessity for securely operating environments. OCI provides a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server using the OCI global IP number 169.254.169.254. All compute instances should be configured to use this NTP service.

#### Regulations and Compliance

The customer is responsible for setting the access rules to services and environments that require stakeholders’ integration to the tenancy to comply with all applicable regulations. Oracle will support in accomplishing this task.

## Deployment Build
<!-- GUIDANCE -->
<!--
The Deployment Build is a list of all OCI resources needed for the implementation. The checklist below defines mandatory requirements as per project scope for the implementation.

Agile Approach: The architect creates and fills in the first version of this table. We work together with our customers to get and confirm the detailed data. Afterwards, the architect and the implementer are working together to iteratively fill these tables. In the meantime some development might already been done by the implementers.

RACI: The architect is Accountable and Responsible for this section. The implementer will actively Consult to provide missing data.

Automatic Parsing: This section is going to be automatically parsed by the implementers. As architects, please try to avoid changing the sub-section names or table structures and attributes. Change only with a strong need, and let me (Alexander Hodicke) know if you need a change here. In addition, please put a comment around each table as seen in the example below - Do not delete them.

<!--### Phase 1: <name>
<!-- Guidance -->
<!--
Please group the Deployment Build into phases depending on the size of the engagement. Each chapter of the Deployment Build belongs to a phase and represents an iterative implementation. First we implement phase 1 and we need to collect data here for that phase. Rearrange the chapters to fit to the right phases. An implementation could have as many phases as needed, and if it has just one, do not group it into just a single phase.

Please group the Deployment Build into phases depending on the size of the engagement. Each chapter of the deployment Build belongs to a phase and represents an iterative implementation. Secondly we implement phase 2 and we need to collect data here for that phase. Rearrange the chapters to fit to the right phases. An implementation could have as many Phases as needed, and if it has just one, do not group it into just a single Phases.
