The content in this folder is about the [WebLogic for Oracle Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/weblogic-container/index.html) deployment.


## Which kind of assets are we making available?

In this location we are making available:

- Architecture examples 
- Reusable assets, as questionnaires, sizing tools, diagrams examples
- Best practices and guidelines
- Technical Briefs 

## How to use these asset?

This content has been shared with the goal of facilitate the adoption of Oracle technology and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a Cloud Platform.
The examples collected here are to be consider as a starting point to develop and build a custom specific architecture that will cover the requirements
peculiar to the workload. As for the various topics addressed we don't expect to cover all aspects but want to present some interesting point of
view or specific deployment examples. The reusable assets are updatable artifacts (drawio diagrams, questionnaires, sizing tools, scripts, etc..)
meant to be used, again, as _templates_ so we expect that readers will use them to build a customized solution that meets the specific requirements
of their projects.

## Content List  

Following is the content currently available:

1. WebLogic for OKE, _ACME_ Architecture: a simple example of a WebLogic workload architecture built in OCI and leveraging the OKE deployment of WebLogic. Included, as reusable asset, there are the Drawio 
diagrams of the architecture.
