# AI Vision
 
OCI Vision is an AI service for performing deep-learningâ€“based image analysis at scale. With prebuilt models available out of the box, developers can easily build image recognition and text recognition into their applications without machine learning (ML) expertise. For industry-specific use cases, developers can automatically train custom vision models with their own data. These models can be used to detect visual anomalies in manufacturing, organize digital media assets, and tag items in images to count products or shipments.
